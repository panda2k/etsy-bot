# Etsy Bot
This is script that can be used to automatically check things out on Etsy. This was made as a for fun project and will likely not be receiving continued updates. 

## Quickstart
The program will run tasks defined in the ./data/tasks.csv file. To create your own, follow the format of the already created task in the file. 

Each task also needs a billing profile. To make your own, follow the format of the already created task in the file. 

Proxies are optional. Add proxies into the proxies.txt file if you would like to use them. Put one on each line in ip:port:username:password format.
